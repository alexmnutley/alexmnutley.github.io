        ABOUT ME: <br>
        <br>
        I am originally from Long Island, NY, and have lived there pretty much my
        whole life. Right now, however, I spend most of my time in Ithaca, NY at college.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am currently studying Operations Research and Engineering at Cornell
         University, on track to graduate in 2022. Outside of class, I often spend my
         free time playing my guitar, learning about how to work on cars, or working
         on some graphic design. My professional interests include the fields of
         Quantitative Finance, Data Science, Statistics, and Programming. <br><br>
        No matter what I am doing, my object is always to grow as a person and learn from
         my experiences. I love to work in teams and receive ideas from others, and
         truly believe that this is the best way to do good work. <br><br>
        My personal and passion projects include, for one, this website! I also maintain
         an Instagram account solely for my music, which you can visit by clicking the music
         link above. Finally, I would like to thank you for visiting my website and reading this!
